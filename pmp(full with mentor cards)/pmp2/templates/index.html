            <div class='testimonial1 '>I had a great experience mentoring juniors for their placements, where I got a chance to share my learnings and helped them avoid the mistakes I made. Some of the students were quite stressed and I am glad that I was able to help them overcome that stressful phase. It is a great way to give back to the community that gave me so much.

            <div class='testimonial2 '>Looking back, the placement semester has been a very important part of my insti life. But it was the constant guidance and support from seniors and peers that made the journey smooth, comfortable, and memorable. So, for me, it was a no-brainer to opt for the Placement Mentorship Program as it provided a platform to give back.  It was a great pleasure to share my experience and knowledge with the mentees and I hope I was able to add value to their placement preparation process. This is indeed a great initiative, all the efforts from the organizing team are well appreciated. I would encourage all the recent graduates to take part in this program and guide the juniors as much as possible.

            <div class='testimonial3 '>Making a proper resume and conveying yourself truly in the interview is not just an important thing but also the only thing which is in your hand when it comes to the final year. Having myself experienced the placement phase, receiving guidance from my seniors during that time along with realizing the importance of placement season, assisting final year students in their resume and interview prep, spending hours on-call reviewing resumes, discussing career options, figuring tech and HR interview questions was a clear choice for me.

            <div class='testimonial4 '>The placement mentoring program gave me a great opportunity to share my experience of the placements with my juniors. The placement at IIT is a stressful process but at the same time, it also gives a great learning opportunity from preparing resumes, to mock GD and PIâ€™s, pre-placement talks, and to final placement sessions. These experiences ultimately help a lot in professional life. To be able to help my juniors with the placements through this program is a very fulfilling experience. Thank you for giving me this opportunity and I recommend all the students to subscribe to this program and make a maximum out of it. </div>

            <div class='testimonial5'>From the beginning of my 2nd year at college, I have built this interest in self-motivation and that was one of the key reasons during my placements as well. I was always looking for opportunities where I can motivate others and share my unsuccessful attempts (which I asked my mentee to avoid later). And this Institute Placement Mentorship Program gave me one more chance to guide my junior friends to prepare both mentally and academically. And the best part about this Program is that all mentees were continuously in touch with their seniors which was very important during the pandemic where there were no physical sessions possible.
            As for the mentees, all of them did a really good job. They were regular in presentations and sessions even though they had to do other academic work. And at the end, the best feeling was when your mentee tells you about their selections ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.
